## Problem to solve
Only a very few customers accept credit cards offers 94.32% (NO) vs 5.68% (YES)


## Method
**Data collection:** This step involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, in our case we had one CSV file

**Data cleaning and transformation:** This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. It also includes identifying outliers and handling them appropriately. Furthermore, we treated data imbalances with oversampling. 

**Data visualization:** This step involves creating various graphs, charts, and other visualizations to understand the data's distribution and identify patterns and trends.

**Data analysis:** This step involves performing statistical analyses on the data to uncover any relationships between the variables.

**Data interpretation:** This step involves drawing conclusions from the data analysis and using the findings to inform decision-making or further research


## Key findings
### Segments
- We identifed five criterai for creating customer segments
2. Credit rating
3. Income level
4. Household size
5. Rewards (cash back)
6. Communication style

### Data quality 
- We found that data quality was an impediement to predicting customer behaviour:
1. High imbalance = lower predictive precision 
2. Missing data: e.g.,  customers (age, gender, regions)

### Methods
- We found a model that had the highest degree of accuracy: 
- Random Forest: 97% prediction accuracy 
and that 
- Oversampling will continue to be useful


## General conclusions
### Recommendations & next steps
1. Retarget customers:
- With newer communication channels e.g. WhatsApp
- Couple this with demographic data

2. Target these segments:
- Poor Credit rating
- Low Income level
- Small Household size
- High appetite for Rewards (cash back)

3. Get more data on:
- Spending patterns and types of purchases (sundries vs big ticket)
- Customer personas and identities (age, region, education, gender, etc)
