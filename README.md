## Problem to solve
Lorem

## Key findings
### Segments
- We identifed five criterai for creating customer segments
2. Credit rating
3. Income level
4. Household size
5. Rewards (cash back)
6. Communication style

### Data quality 
- We found that data quality was an impediement to predicting customer behaviour:
1. High imbalance = lower predictive precision 
2. Missing data: e.g.,  customers (age, gender, regions)

### Methods
- We found a model that had the highest degree of accuracy: 
- Random Forest: 97% prediction accuracy 
and that 
- Oversampling will continue to be useful


## General conclusions
### Recommendations & next steps
1. Retarget customers:
- With newer communication channels e.g. WhatsApp
- Couple this with demographic data

2. Target these segments:
- Poor Credit rating
- Low Income level
- Small Household size
- High appetite for Rewards (cash back)

3. Get more data on:
- Spending patterns and types of purchases (sundries vs big ticket)
- Customer personas and identities (age, region, education, gender, etc)
